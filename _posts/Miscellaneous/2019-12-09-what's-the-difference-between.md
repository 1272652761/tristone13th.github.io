### argument and parameter

A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. 

### simulation and emulation

An emulator can replace the original for *real* use, like a virtual PC emulates a PC.

A simulator is a model for study and analysis.

An emulator will always have to operate close to real-time. For a simulator that is not always the case. A geological simulation could do 1000 years/second or more.

### delay and latency



### index and indicator

"indexes" sounding maybe a little more academic than "indicators". 

### keymap and shortcut

`Every shortcut will have keymap`. To have a shortcut, you need to map one or more keys to it. Shortcut is `what` and keymap is `how`.

Let us say you want to clear your terminal using `Ctrl+K`. Then `Clear` is your shortcut and `Ctrl+K` is your keymap.
