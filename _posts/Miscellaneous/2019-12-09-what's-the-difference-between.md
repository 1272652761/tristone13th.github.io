### argument and parameter

A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. 

### simulation and emulation

An emulator can replace the original for *real* use, like a virtual PC emulates a PC.

A simulator is a model for study and analysis.

An emulator will always have to operate close to real-time. For a simulator that is not always the case. A geological simulation could do 1000 years/second or more.

### index and indicator

"indexes" sounding maybe a little more academic than "indicators". 

### keymap and shortcut

`Every shortcut will have keymap`. To have a shortcut, you need to map one or more keys to it. Shortcut is `what` and keymap is `how`.

Let us say you want to clear your terminal using `Ctrl+K`. Then `Clear` is your shortcut and `Ctrl+K` is your keymap.

### MDP and Finite State Machine

For a pair of specific state and action, the next state is stochastic in MDP and finite in FSM. Actually,  FSM is a sort of MDP named Finite MDP.

### Safety and Security

 One of the primary difference between the two terms is their definition. Security refers to the protection of individuals, organizations, and properties against external threats that are likely to cause harm. It is clear that security is generally focused on ensuring that external factors do not cause trouble or unwelcome situation to the organization, individuals, and the properties within the premises. On the other hand, safety is the feeling of being protected from the factors that causes harm. It is also important to highlight that an individual who controls the risk causing factors has the feeling of being safe.
