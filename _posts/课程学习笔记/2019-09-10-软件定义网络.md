- **Software Defined Networking (SDN)**: A new networking paradigm whereby the behavior of a network is controlled by a single high-level software program. The general term for network architectures whereby the control plane (software that controls network behavior) and the data plane (the devices that forward traffic) are separate from one another.
- **Control plane**: The functions in the network that control the behavior of the network (e.g., network paths, forwarding behavior). Typically, the control plane is instantiated as a single, high-level software controller.
- **Data plane**: The functions in the network that are responsible for forwarding (or not forwarding) traffic. Typically, the data plane is instantiated as forwarding tables in routers, switches, firewalls, and middleboxes.

# 传统交换机与SDN交换机的区别

前者包含了数据层和控制层，后者仅仅包含数据层，这也便是SDN的定义：将控制平面和数据平面进行了有效的分离。
