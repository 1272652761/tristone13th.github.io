# Class #1

Introduction to **Essay Writing**.

# *Class #2*

There are commonly four type of essays: **Description**, **Narration**, **Exposition** and **Argumentation**.

**Toulmin method of logic**: **Claim**, **Data**, **Warrant**.

**Topic**: Should people be judged by their social media posting?

**Claim**: We don't think people should be judged by their social media posing.

**Data 1**: According to my personal experience, The contents posted on social media by people are delicately designed.

**Warrant 1**: Because the contents posted on social media are delicately designed, they can only represent the virtual profile of them,  so what you see on social media is what they want you to see, not the real person they truly are.

# *Class #3*

**Toulmin method of logic**: **Claim**, **Data**, **Warrant**, **Counterclaim** and **Rebuttal**.

**Claim**: Students should NOT be forced to wear uniforms to school.

**Counterclaim**: Students should be forced to wear uniforms to school.

**Rebuttal**: Many people think that wearing school uniforms can make students more collectively aware, but the students' sense of belonging should be psychological rather than formal. Forcing students to wear uniforms will only make students more tired of school restrictions on them, thus hindering the formation of collective identity.

**Claim**: The school year should be extended into the summer.

# *Class #4*

**Claim 1**: Purchasing unhealthy foods through a tax is helpful for rising obesity among Americans.

**Data 1**: Americans today are consuming almost 20% more calories than they did in the early 1980’s, and those calories are coming from increasingly less-healthy sources, mainly high-fat and high-sugar processed foods.

**Data 2**: processed foods and drinks are increasingly more affordable than the fruits, vegetables, and whole grains needed to sustain a healthy diet.

**Data 3**: Cost, more so than preference, influences purchasing choices. 

**Counterclaim**: 

smoking is more of a lifestyle choice than eating, it is rather the choice of what foods to eat which will hopefully be affected in the long run.
