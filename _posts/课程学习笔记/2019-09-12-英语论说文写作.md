**Topic**: Should people be judged by their social media posting?

**Claim**: We don't think people should be judged by their social media posing.

**Data 1**: According to my personal experience, The contents posted on social media by people are delicately designed.

**Warrant 1**: Because the contents posted on social media are delicately designed, they can only represent the virtual profile of them,  so what you see on social media is what they want you to see, not the real person they truly are.

# *Class #2*

**Claim**: Students should NOT be forced to wear uniforms to school.

**Counterclaim**: Students should be forced to wear uniforms to school.

**Rebuttal**: Many people think that wearing school uniforms can make students more collectively aware, but the students' sense of belonging should be psychological rather than formal. Forcing students to wear uniforms will only make students more tired of school restrictions on them, thus hindering the formation of collective identity.

**Claim**: The school year should be extended into the summer.
