# 合句（Compound Sentence）

合句，又叫做**并列复合句**，**并列句**。

> A **compound sentence** is composed of at least two independent clauses. It does not require a dependent clause. The clauses are joined by a **coordinating** conjunction (with or without a comma), a semicolon that functions as a conjunction, a colon instead of a semicolon between two sentences when the second sentence explains or illustrates the first sentence and no coordinating conjunction is being used to connect the sentences, or a conjunctive adverb preceded by a semicolon. A conjunction can be used to make a compound sentence. Conjunctions are words such as **and, but, or, nor, so, and yet**. Examples:

一个合句，应该包含至少两个相互**独立**的句子。有四种情况：

- 这两个句子通过**连词**来进行连接（中间可以有**逗号**也可以**没有逗号**）；
- 一个**分号**在中间，其可以当成一个连词来看待；
- 一个**冒号**在中间，第二个句子用来解释第一个句子，**中间可以没有连词**；
- 一个**分号**在中间，后面接一个**连接副词**。

它们的例子分别如下：

- I started on time, but I arrived late.
- I will accept your offer or decline it; these are the two options.
- The law was passed: from April 1, all cars would have to be tested.
- The war was lost; consequently, the whole country was occupied.

当两个句子中间用了**逗号**，却没有放置合适的**连词**时，我们认为这是**语法错误**。例子如下：

- The sun was shining, everyone appeared happy.
