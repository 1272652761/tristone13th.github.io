# About Me

## Profile

My nickname is `云中君`, AKA `tristone13th`.  I was born in `Handan City, Hebei Province` and majored in `Computer Science` in `Fudan university, Shanghai`. My research direction is focus on `Computer Network & Reinforcement Learning` and welcome to have a deep communication with me!

My email is [tristone13th@outlook.com](https://outlook.live.com).

## Hobbies

I like play billiard and always play it with my best friends though my playing technique is not so good. I am concerned about `La Liga`, which is the best football league in this world, and my favorite team is `RCD Espanyol` because of  `Wu Lei`!

In addition to sports, I also like art very much. In terms of literature,  `The Story of the Stone（Dream of the Red Chamber，紅樓夢） ` is my favorite Chinese novel and I regard it as the beauty and  pearl in the human history. The `Kun Opera` is also my favorite and I think it is a GIFT designed for my ears.

Despite these, I have to say that the `Classical Chinese（古代漢語）` is also in my favor list, **既見君子，雲胡不喜？**

 Thanks for your attention!
