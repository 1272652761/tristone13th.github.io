## Hobbies

I like play billiard and always play it with my best friends though my playing technique is not so good, I am also focus on `Laliga`, the best football league in this world, and my favorite team is `RCD Espanyol` because of  `Wu Lei`!

In addition to sports, I also like art very much. For an instance of literature,  `The Story of the Stone ` is my favorite Chinese novel and I regard it as the beauty and  pearl in the human history. The `Kun Opera` is also my favorite and I think it is a GIFT designed for my ears.

Despite these, I have to say that the `Classical Chinese Language` is also in my favor list, 既见君子，云胡不喜？
